**Key Idea:**  The Open-R1-Math-220k dataset appears to be a high-quality, synthetic dataset designed for training reasoning models. It's significantly larger than GSM8K (220k vs. ~8k), and the blog post suggests it's been filtered to maintain a high level of correctness and clarity. This makes it an excellent candidate for *continued pre-training* or, in this case, *continued fine-tuning*.  We're *not* starting from scratch; we're building on the existing model's knowledge which started as the Qwen 2.5 .5B distilled version. Think of this as a test of what do models retain from one training to the next and how small (smol) of a model can be effectively to be trained to reason through complex problem solving. 

Anyone in the HuggingFace SmolAgent class welcome to join. I will be working on this idea of how smol of a model can be trained to work with an equally smolagent to accomplish a specific task. 

**1. Access and Load the New Dataset:**

   *   **Dataset Name:**  First, confirm the exact name of the dataset on Hugging Face.  The blog post mentions "Open-R1-Math-220k", but we need the full identifier (e.g., `some_org/open-r1-math-220k`).  Let's assume for now it's `open-r1-math-220k` (no org needed in this dataset).
   *   **Load with `datasets`:** Use the Hugging Face `datasets` library, just like you did for GSM8K.

   ```python
   from datasets import load_dataset

   openr1_dataset = load_dataset("open-r1-math-220k")

   # Inspect the dataset structure:
   print(openr1_dataset)
   # Example: Examine a single data point:
   print(openr1_dataset['train'][0])  # Assuming it has a 'train' split
   ```

**2. Understand the Dataset Structure:**

   *   **Examine the Format:** Critically, you need to understand how the new dataset is structured.  What are the fields (keys) in each example?  The blog post *strongly* suggests the data is already in a good format, which is promising.  It mentions "high-quality chain-of-thought reasoning." You need to identify:
      *   The field containing the **question/problem** (e.g., `"problem"`, `"question"`, `"input"`).
      *   The field containing the **reasoning steps** (e.g., `"rationale"`, `"reasoning"`, `"chain_of_thought"`).
      *   The field containing the **final answer** (e.g., `"answer"`, `"solution"`, `"output"`).

   *   **Consistency with Your XML Format:**  *This is crucial.* Your original model was trained to output reasoning steps in a specific XML format (`<reasoning>...</reasoning><final_answer>...</final_answer>`).
      *   **Ideal Scenario:** If the Open-R1 dataset *already* uses a similar XML format, or a very easily convertible format (like a structured JSON), your adaptation will be much easier.  You might only need to adjust your extraction functions.
      *   **Less Ideal Scenario:** If the dataset uses a *completely different* format (e.g., plain text reasoning), you have two main options:
         1.  **Reformat Open-R1:** Write a function to transform the Open-R1 data *into* your XML format. This might involve some heuristics and could be the most complex part. You are essentially forcing the new data to conform to your *existing* model's output expectations.
         2.  **Adapt Your Model (More Advanced):**  Modify your model's training (and potentially the reward functions) to *accept* the Open-R1 format.  This is a more substantial change, and I'd recommend the reformatting approach first.

   *  **Key Fields:** After exploring the dataset structure, in the first entry for example, you will notice the two core fields that you need: **instruction** and **output**. You will adapt your prior data loading and formating to work with these new dataset.

**3. Adapt Data Preprocessing:**

   *   **Replace `get_gsm8k_questions`:** You'll create a new function, say `get_openr1_questions`, that mirrors the structure of your `get_gsm8k_questions` but adapts to the Open-R1 dataset.

   ```python
   def get_openr1_questions(dataset, split="train"):  # Assuming a 'train' split
       questions = []
       answers = []
       reasonings = []

       for example in dataset[split]:
           # --- ADAPT THESE LINES BASED ON THE ACTUAL FIELD NAMES ---
           question = example["instruction"]  # Replace "instruction" if needed
           
           output = example["output"]

           answer_start_index = output.rfind("=") + 1
            
           
           
           reasoning =  output[:answer_start_index] # Replace "reasoning" if needed
           answer =  output[answer_start_index:].strip()  # Replace "answer" if needed
           # ----------------------------------------------------------

           questions.append(question)
           answers.append(answer)
           reasonings.append(reasoning)
           #You do NOT need to append the answer to the prompt, because of how we 
           #define the reward functions in our GRPO implementation

       return questions, answers, reasonings

   # --- Usage ---
   openr1_questions, openr1_answers, openr1_reasonings = get_openr1_questions(openr1_dataset)
   ```

   *   **System Prompt (Likely Unchanged):** You can *probably* keep your existing `SYSTEM_PROMPT`.  The goal is still to encourage chain-of-thought reasoning, even with a different dataset. However, *test this!* It's possible the Open-R1 data responds better to a slightly different system prompt.

   *   **Extraction Functions (Potentially Adapt):**  You *might* need to adapt `extract_xml_answer` and `extract_hash_answer`.
      *   If the Open-R1 data uses the *exact same* XML structure, you're good!
      *   If the structure is *slightly different* (e.g., different tag names, attributes), modify these functions to parse the new structure.
      *   If the format is *completely different*, you'll need entirely new extraction functions.

      ```python
      def extract_openr1_answer(generated_text):
         answer_start_index = generated_text.rfind("=") + 1
         return generated_text[answer_start_index:].strip()

      #Likely can delete the HASH example and also can delete all the formatting functions
      ```

**4. Modify Training Data Loading:**

   *   **Replace Dataset in Trainer:** In your notebook, where you create the `GRPOTrainer`, you'll replace the GSM8K dataset with your processed Open-R1 data.

   ```python
    # OLD:
    # train_questions, train_answers, train_reasonings = get_gsm8k_questions(train_dataset)

    # NEW:
    train_questions, train_answers, train_reasonings = get_openr1_questions(openr1_dataset)

    trainer = GRPOTrainer(
        model,
        args=training_args,
        # ... other arguments ...
        train_dataset=train_questions,  # Use questions directly
        eval_dataset=val_questions,
        tokenizer=tokenizer,
        compute_metrics=None,  # You handle metrics through reward functions
        grpo_loss_kwargs={
            "answer_grounding_loss_weight": answer_grounding_loss_weight,
        }
    )
   ```

**5. Reward Function Considerations:**

   *   **`correctness_reward_func`:** This should still be your primary reward.  The logic of comparing the extracted answer to the ground truth remains the same. *However*, ensure your adapted extraction functions are correctly pulling out the answer from the Open-R1 data.
   *   **Format-Related Rewards (Potentially Remove/Simplify):**
      *   If Open-R1 already has very consistent reasoning structure, you *might* be able to *remove* or significantly *reduce the weight* of `strict_format_reward_func`, `soft_format_reward_func`, and `xmlcount_reward_func`. The goal here is to let the inherent quality of the Open-R1 data guide the formatting, rather than forcing your specific XML structure. This simplifies your training.
      *   If Open-R1's format is inconsistent, keep these rewards (or adapt them) to enforce your desired structure.
   * **Adapt Reward Input:** Adapt your reward functions to work with the reasoning that you get back from `get_openr1_questions`
     ```python
     def correctness_reward_func(generated_texts, reference_answers):
         rewards = []
         #generated_texts = generated_texts["completion_text"]
         for gen_text, ref_answer in zip(generated_texts, reference_answers):
             extracted_answer = extract_openr1_answer(gen_text)
             # print("Extracted: ", extracted_answer)
             # print("Ref: ", ref_answer)
             # Check if the extracted answer and reference answer can be converted to numbers for comparison
             try:
                 if abs(float(extracted_answer) - float(ref_answer)) < 1e-8:  # Using a small tolerance
                   rewards.append(1)
                 else:
                   rewards.append(0)
             except (ValueError, TypeError):
               # Handle cases where conversion to float fails
                 print("here?", extracted_answer, ref_answer, gen_text)
                 rewards.append(0)
             # if extracted_answer == ref_answer:
             #     rewards.append(1)
             # else:
             #     rewards.append(0)

         return rewards
     ```

**6. Training Hyperparameters (Adjustments):**

   *   **`num_train_epochs`:** Since Open-R1 is much larger, you *might* want to experiment with more than one epoch.  However, *start with one* and monitor for overfitting.  Use a validation set (see below).
   *   **`learning_rate`:** You might need to *reduce* the learning rate further, as you're already starting from a fine-tuned model.  Try `1e-6` or even lower.
   *   **`per_device_train_batch_size`:** Keep this at 1.
   *   **`gradient_accumulation_steps`:**  Adjust as needed to fit your GPU memory.  You can potentially increase this if Open-R1 examples are shorter than GSM8K.
   *   **`num_generations`:** Keep at 16 for sufficient exploration.
   * **Validation Set:**  The `openr1_dataset` likely has a validation split (e.g., `openr1_dataset['validation']`). Use this to evaluate your model during training and prevent overfitting. Create `val_questions`, `val_answers` and `val_reasonings` using get_open_r1_questions`

**7. Training and Evaluation:**

   *   Run the training just as you did before, but with the Open-R1 data and adjusted parameters.
   *   Carefully monitor the training loss and the rewards (via Weights & Biases).
   *   Evaluate on the validation set frequently to detect overfitting.

**8. Inference (No Changes):**

   *   Your `hf_grpotuned_pipeline.py` script *should not need changes*, *provided* your extraction functions in the notebook are correctly parsing the model's output after this second stage of training.  The script simply calls the model; it doesn't care *how* the model was trained.

**Key Improvements Over Original Approach:**

*   **Leveraging a Larger, Higher-Quality Dataset:**  The most significant improvement.
*   **Potential for Simpler Reward Structure:**  If Open-R1 is well-formatted, you can simplify the training process.
*   **Continued Fine-tuning:**  Building upon existing knowledge, rather than starting from scratch.

**Debugging and Iteration:**

*   **Print Extensively:**  During development, print out the processed data, extracted answers, and reward values to ensure everything is working as expected.
*   **Start Small:**  Don't try to train on the entire Open-R1 dataset at once.  Use a small subset (e.g., 100 examples) to debug your code quickly.
*   **Iterate:**  Experiment with different hyperparameters and reward weights to optimize performance.

By following these steps, you'll be able to leverage the Open-R1 dataset to create an even more powerful math reasoning model, building directly upon your existing work. Remember to adapt the code snippets based on the *exact* structure of the Open-R1 dataset once you have access to it. Good luck!
